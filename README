This repository contains all the code related to our work &quot;Size-
independent, between-individual variability in feed ingestion rate in
European seabass(Dicentrarchus labrax)&quot;, by Joaquim Tomàs-Ferrer, Irene
Moro-Martínez, Enrique Massutí-Pascual, Amàlia Grau and Miquel Palmer.
The R script jtf_feeding_analysis (and the input data file
input_jtf.RData) are designed for analyzing the effect of several
parameters on fish feeding rates using
feeding trials observed data. This script contains several steps:

1. Loading libraries

2. Loading data

3. STAN model specification
The script writes a Stan model into a file named model.stan.

4. Priors and initial values

5. Compiling and running the model

6. Saving the output

7. Exploring results
