This reprository contains all the code related to our work "Size-independent, between-individual variability in feed ingestion rate in European seabass 
(Dicentrarchus labrax)", by Joaquim Tomàs-Ferrer, Irene Moro-Martínez, Enrique Massutí-Pascual, Amàlia Grau and Miquel Palmer.

The R script jtf_feeding_analysis (and the input data file input_jtf.RData) are designed for analysing the effect of several parameters on fish feeding rates using 
feeding trials observed data. This script contains several steps:

1. Loading libraries

2. Loading data

3. STAN model specification
The script writes a Stan model into a file named model.stan.

4. Prioirs and initial values

4. Compiling and running the model

6. Saving the output

7. Exploring results

7. Results summary
